sphinxtrain
------------------------------------------
This is SphinxTrain, Carnegie Mellon University's open source acoustic model
trainer. This directory contains the scripts and instructions necessary for
building models for the CMU Sphinx Recognizer.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.6.0-0.203.gf78009cb1ccf
  liblapack0-3.12.0-1
  libopenblas-0.3.26-1
  perl-5.36.3-1
  perl_base-5.36.3-1
  python39-3.9.18-2

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.43.1-1
  cmake-3.28.3-1
  cygport-0.36.9-1
  gcc-core-12.4.0-3
  gcc-g++-12.4.0-3
  liblapack-devel-3.12.0-1
  ninja-1.12.0-1
  python39-3.9.18-2

Canonical download:
  https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinxtrain/archive/refs/tags/v5.0.0.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack sphinxtrain-5.0.0-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./sphinxtrain-5.0.0-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/sphinxtrain-5.0.0-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/sphinxtrain-5.0.0-X.tar.xz
