libecap
------------------------------------------
eCAP is a software interface that allows a network application, such as an HTTP
proxy or an ICAP server, to outsource content analysis and adaptation to a
loadable module. For each applicable protocol message being processed, an
eCAP-enabled host application supplies the message details to the adaptation
module and gets back an adapted message, a not interested response, or a block
this message now! instruction. These exchanges often include message bodies.

  1. unpack libecap-1.0.1-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./libecap-1.0.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/libecap-1.0.1-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libecap-1.0.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libecap3-1.0.1-X.tar.xz
