SUMMARY="Edge Addition Planarity Suite"
DESCRIPTION="The primary purpose of this repository is to provide implementations of the
edge addition planar graph embedding algorithm and related algorithms,
including a planar graph drawing method, an isolator for a minimal subgraph
obstructing planarity in non-planar graphs, outerplanar graph embedder and
obstruction isolator algorithms, and tester/isolator algorithms for subgraphs
homeomorphic to K2,3, K4, and K3,3. The C implementations in this repository
are the reference implementations of algorithms."
