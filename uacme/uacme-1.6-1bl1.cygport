SUMMARY="ACMEv2 client"
DESCRIPTION="lightweight client for the RFC8555 ACMEv2 protocol, written in plain C code
with minimal dependencies (libcurl and one of GnuTLS, OpenSSL or mbedTLS). The
ACMEv2 protocol allows a Certificate Authority (https://letsencrypt.org is a
popular one) and an applicant to automate the process of verification and
certificate issuance. The protocol also provides facilities for other
certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation."
