dieharder
------------------------------------------
Dieharder is a random number generator (rng) testing suite. It is intended to
test generators, not files of possibly random numbers as the latter is a
fallacious view of what it means to be random. Is the number 7 random? If it is
generated by a random process, it might be. If it is made up to serve the
purpose of some argument (like this one) it is not. Perfect random number
generators produce unlikely sequences of random numbers -- at exactly the right
average rate. Testing a rng is therefore quite subtle.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.6.0-0.225.g8ee8b0c974d7
  libdieharder-devel-3.31.1-1bl3
  libdieharder3-3.31.1-1bl3
  libgsl19-2.3-2
  pkg-config-2.3.0-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  autoconf-15-2
  automake-20240607-1
  binutils-2.43.1-1
  cygport-0.36.9-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack dieharder-3.31.1-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./dieharder-3.31.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/dieharder-3.31.1-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/dieharder-3.31.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libdieharder3-3.31.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libdieharder-devel-3.31.1-X.tar.xz
