SUMMARY="Simple file hashing utility"
DESCRIPTION="sha is a simple program that hashes files. It uses the National Institute of
Standards and Technology's Secure Hash Algorithm. It can use SHA-1, SHA-256,
SHA-384, or SHA-512, which generate respectively, hashes of 160, 256, 384, or
512 bits. sha can be used in scripts to do, for example, file integrity
checking. The C implementations of the algorithms might be useful in other
projects as well."
