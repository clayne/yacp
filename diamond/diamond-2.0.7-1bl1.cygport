SUMMARY="Accelerated BLAST compatible local sequence aligner"
DESCRIPTION="DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches and
functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI BLAST software tools. It is
suitable for protein-protein search as well as DNA-protein search on short
reads and longer sequences including contigs and assemblies, providing a
speedup of BLAST ranging up to x20,000."
