libevhtp
------------------------------------------
Libevhtp was created as a replacement API for Libevent's current HTTP API. The
reality of libevent's http interface is that it was created as a JIT server,
meaning the developer never thought of it being used for creating a
full-fledged HTTP service. Infact I am under the impression that the libevent
http API was designed almost as an example of what you can do with libevent.
It's not Apache in a box, but more and more developers are attempting to use
it as so.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.6.4-1
  libevent2.1_7-2.1.12-1
  libevhtp-devel-1.2.18-1bl4
  libevhtp0-1.2.18-1bl4
  libssl3-3.0.17-1
  pkg-config-2.5.1-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.45-1
  cmake-3.28.3-1
  cygport-0.37.2-1
  gcc-core-13.4.0-1
  libevent-devel-2.1.12-1
  libssl-devel-3.0.17-1

Build instructions:
  1. unpack libevhtp-1.2.18-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./libevhtp-1.2.18-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/libevhtp-1.2.18-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libevhtp-1.2.18-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libevhtp0-1.2.18-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libevhtp-devel-1.2.18-X.tar.xz
