clann
------------------------------------------
To construct supertrees and explore the underlying phylogenomic information
from gene trees. Clann implements several well known supertree methods
(including the ability to apply bootstrapping to them) can calculate consensus
trees and provides methods to manage sets of gene trees, pruning selected taxa,
filtering based on a number of criteria, automatically pruning species-specific
duplicates and more. Also implemented is a gene-tree reconciliation approach to
try to utilise genetic information from more than just single-copy gene-trees,
this can be used as a criterion for estimating species trees. Feed back on
these approaches are welcome! Finally, Clann can also calculate Robinson-Doulds
(RF) and SPR distances between sets of trees, create randomised versions of
sets of trees and implementes a PTP test for informativeness (the YAPTP test)
of a set of trees provided. Clann has been continually developed since 2003 and
suggestions for new features and tools are welcome.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack clann-4.2.5-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./clann-4.2.5-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/clann-4.2.5-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/clann-4.2.5-X.tar.xz
