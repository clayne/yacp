uARMSolver
------------------------------------------
The framework is written fully in C++ and runs on all platforms. It allows
users to preprocess their data in a transaction database, to make
discretization of data, to search for association rules and to guide a
presentation/visualization of the best rules found using external tools. As
opposed to the existing software packages or frameworks, this also supports
numerical and real-valued types of attributes besides the categorical ones.
Mining the association rules is defined as an optimization and solved using the
nature-inspired algorithms that can be incorporated easily. Because the
algorithms normally discover a huge amount of association rules, the framework
enables a modular inclusion of so-called visual guiders for extracting the
knowledge hidden in data, and visualize these using external tools.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack uARMSolver-0.2.6-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./uARMSolver-0.2.6-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/uARMSolver-0.2.6-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/uARMSolver-0.2.6-X.tar.xz
