luabind
------------------------------------------
Luabind is a library that helps you create bindings between C++ and Lua. It has
the ability to expose functions and classes, written in C++, to Lua. It will
also supply the functionality to define classes in Lua and let them derive from
other Lua classes or C++ classes. Lua classes can override virtual functions
from their C++ base classes. It is written towards Lua 5.0, and does not work
with Lua 4.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.5.7-1
  libgcc1-12.4.0-3
  liblua5.3-5.3.6-4
  libluabind-devel-0.9.1+git20150408-1bl2
  libluabind0-0.9.1+git20150408-1bl2
  libstdc++6-12.4.0-3
  pkg-config-2.3.0-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.44-1
  cmake-3.28.3-1
  cygport-0.36.9-1
  gcc-core-12.4.0-3
  gcc-g++-12.4.0-3
  liblua-devel-5.3.6-4
  lua-5.3.6-4
  ninja-1.12.1-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack luabind-0.9.1+git20150408-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./luabind-0.9.1+git20150408-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/luabind-0.9.1+git20150408-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/luabind-0.9.1+git20150408-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libluabind0-0.9.1+git20150408-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libluabind-devel-0.9.1+git20150408-X.tar.xz
