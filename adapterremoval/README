adapterremoval
------------------------------------------
AdapterRemoval searches for and removes adapter sequences from High-Throughput
Sequencing (HTS) data and (optionally) trims low quality bases from the 3' end
of reads following adapter removal. AdapterRemoval can analyze both single end
and paired end data, and can be used to merge overlapping paired-ended reads
into (longer) consensus sequences. Additionally, AdapterRemoval can construct a
consensus adapter sequence for paired-ended reads, if which this information is
not available.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack adapterremoval-2.3.4-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./adapterremoval-2.3.4-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/adapterremoval-2.3.4-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/adapterremoval-2.3.4-X.tar.xz
