SUMMARY="Build vector tilesets from collections of GeoJSON features"
DESCRIPTION="The goal of Tippecanoe is to enable making a scale-independent view of your
data, so that at any level from the entire world to a single building, you can
see the density and texture of the data rather than a simplification from
dropping supposedly unimportant features or clustering or aggregating them."
