SUMMARY="Weighted finite-state transducer library"
DESCRIPTION="OpenFst is a library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching
weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs). Weighted finite-state transducers
are automata where each transition has an input label, an output label, and a
weight. The more familiar finite-state acceptor is represented as a transducer
with each transition's input and output label equal. Finite-state acceptors
are used to represent sets of strings (specifically, regular or rational
sets); finite-state transducers are used to represent binary relations between
pairs of strings (specifically, rational transductions). The weights can be
used to represent the cost of taking a particular transition."
