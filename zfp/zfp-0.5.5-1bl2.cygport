SUMMARY="Library for compressed numerical arrays that support high throughput read and write random access"
DESCRIPTION="zfp is an open source C/C++ library for compressed numerical arrays that
support high throughput read and write random access. zfp also supports
streaming compression of integer and floating-point data, e.g., for applications
that read and write large data sets to and from disk."
