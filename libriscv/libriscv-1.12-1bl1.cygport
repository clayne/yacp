SUMMARY="Fastest RISC-V sandbox"
DESCRIPTION="libriscv is a simple, slim and complete sandbox that is highly embeddable and
configurable. It is a specialty emulator that specializes in low-latency,
low-footprint emulation. libriscv may be the only one of its kind. Where other
solutions routinely require ~50-150ns to call a VM function and return,
libriscv requires 3ns. libriscv is also routinely faster than other
interpreters, JIT-compilers and binary translators. libriscv has specialized
APIs that make passing data in and out of the sandbox safe and low-latency."
