diskscan
------------------------------------------
DiskScan is a Unix/Linux tool to scan a block device and check if there are
unreadable sectors, in addition it uses read latency times as an assessment for
a near failure as sectors that are problematic to read usually entail many
retries. This can be used to assess the state of the disk and maybe decide on a
replacement in advance to its imminent failure. The disk self test may or may
not pick up on such clues depending on the disk vendor decision making logic.

  1. unpack diskscan-0.21-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./diskscan-0.21-X.cygport all

This will create:
