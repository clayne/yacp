SUMMARY="Read metadata from Python packages"
DESCRIPTION="importlib_metadata is a library which provides an API for accessing an
installed packageâ€™s metadata (see PEP 566), such as its entry points or its
top-level name. This functionality intends to replace most uses of
pkg_resources entry point API and metadata API. Along with importlib.resources
in Python 3.7 and newer (backported as importlib_resources for older versions
of Python), this can eliminate the need to use the older and less efficient
pkg_resources package."
